# 🧠 Self-Learning Code Store – Personal Practice Projects

This repository contains my personal learning projects during my journey to become a Full Stack Developer. I come from a non-technical background (English major) and am actively building programming skills through project-based learning.

## 📌 Current Project

🌐 Personal Store Landing Page  
A beginner-friendly static website using:

- HTML5: semantic structure
- CSS3: layout & styling
- JavaScript: simple dark/light mode toggle

This project is my first step in applying what I’ve learned from The Odin Project and GitHub Copilot assistance. I separated HTML, CSS, and JS into individual files to practice code organization.
